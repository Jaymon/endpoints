# Endpoints Documentation

All the files in this directory should help you understand how to get the most from Endpoints.

Just getting started? Read about [controllers](https://github.com/firstopinion/endpoints/blob/master/docs/CONTROLLERS.md) as that's the most important piece to understand, once controllers make sense, you can add some [decorators](https://github.com/firstopinion/endpoints/blob/master/docs/DECORATORS.md) to get the most out of each request.
